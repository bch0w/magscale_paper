+ Abstract
>Problem, method, solution, discussion...

+ Introduction
> we have a large collection of events
> we routinely compare amplitude ratios for phase velocities
	> this is a linear equation, but if they don't decay linearly, phase velocity is all over
> we want to understand how rotations decay compared to translations
> how do we do this? we make 'magnitude scales' to quantify decay characterstics
> these are not real magnitudes because we are geographically biased and we are not averaging over hundreds of instruments like is common
> can we connect this amplitude decay to actual surface waves
> can we recreate this behavior with synthetics
